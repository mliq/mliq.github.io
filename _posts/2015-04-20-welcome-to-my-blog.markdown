Hi, and welcome to my blog!

In this post, I will note the motivation for creating this blog, and a little about me.

<h2>Me:</h2>
I have always loved computers, logic, problem-solving, and, of course, the Internet and all the amazing doors it opens. But, I did not choose to pursue a CS degree in college, probably because I did not really have any idea at that time what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, and a liberal arts degree just seemed to leave more options open. 

After working as a journalist, then in as a daytrader, I have decided I really want to become a software developer. Fortunately, it seems that world needs more of them, and some amazing opportunities for making this career switch have appeared: 2-3 month highly-intensive educational programs usually called “coding bootcamps.”

<h2>Prime Digital Academy: </h2>
I am currently delighted to be a member of the first (“beta”) cohort of [Prime Digital Academy](http://primeacademy.io), and felt motivated to start this blog, primarily to give others who may be considering the career switch some more insight into the process, and to Prime in particular. 

Prime is an 18-week Full-Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp with the first cohort running March 3 - July 3, 2015, and currently taking applications for cohorts after that. It is a Javascript-focused program, teaching the MEAN Stack, which is MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, & Node.js. We will also come out well-versed in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, Sass, Bootstrap, and Grunt. And, with plenty of experience using Git and Github for version control. 6 weeks of the 18 are "Preloading," in which we worked individually from home, and came together virtually for once weekly meetings and online discussion board assignments. The next 12 weeks are in class, 8 am to 6 pm everyday, plus weekend assignments.

Another very important part of Prime is the focus on Public Speaking, Communication, & Leadership Training: I'll talk more about that in my next post, [Prime First Week Review]({% post_url 2015-04-20-prime-first-week-review %}).

Happy to answer any questions and connect with like-minded individuals through e-mail or twitter!
