Hi, and welcome to my blog!

In this post, I will note the motivation for creating this blog, and a little about who I am.

In the [next post]({% post_url 2015-01-29-how-this-blog-was-made %}), I will go over the steps I followed to create this site.

I have recently embarked on a journey to become a professional software developer. Currently, the majority of my expertise is in data science (statistics and finance, R and Excel / VBA). I am excited to be expanding my knowledge in visual and user experience (UX) aspects of design. I love to make things that are streamlined and elegant to the senses, while of course also providing great, error-free and efficient functionality under the hood.

So, this blog will be focused on issues related to web development as I progress in this journey, and I hope that what I share here might help others on a similar path.

Many times throughout my life I have experienced a concept that I am really not able to wrap my head around, until I arrive to an explanation that is put in just a certain way that makes it seem so simple and easy.  After that, a wall is often broken down, and one can often return to previously unintelligible explanations with a huge boost in understanding. I hope I might return the infinite favors the web has bestowed upon me over the years by possibly providing an explanation that allows others to achieve a similar breakthrough moment.

Finally, writing this blog will also no doubt help me, as writing and teaching a concept to others is a great way to explore and cement new concepts in your mind, even if that someone else is an imaginary reader.
